# GitHub Actions to Free Disk Space on Ubuntu runners

A customizable GitHub Actions to free disk space on Ubuntu GitHub Actions runners.

On a typical Ubuntu runner, with all options turned on (or not turned off rather), this can clear up to 25 GB of disk space in about 3 minutes (the longest period is calling `apt` to uninstall packages).

Please don't hesitate to [submit issues](https://github.com/jlumbroso/free-disk-space/issues) to report problems or suggest new features (or sets of files to help remove). Also, please ⭐️ the repo if you like this GitHub Actions! Thanks! 😊

## Example

```yaml
name: Free Disk Space (Ubuntu)
on: push

jobs:
  free-disk-space:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - name: Free Disk Space (Ubuntu)
      uses: jlumbroso/free-disk-space@main
      with:
        # all of these default to true, but feel free to set to
        # false if necessary for your workflow
        android: true
        dotnet: true
        haskell: true
        large-packages: true
        swap-storage: true
```

## Acknowledgement

This GitHub Actions came around because I kept rewriting the same few lines of `rm -rf` code.

Here are a few sources of inspiration:
